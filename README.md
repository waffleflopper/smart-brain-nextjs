## What is this??
This was my attempt at creating the final project for Zero-to-Mastery Web Developer course utilizing NextJS for an all-in-one solution for both front and back end.  All CRUD calls are run through NextJS's API routes to forgo the need for using Node/Express as a backend.  Auth0 was utilized for authentication in order to familiarize myself with 3rd party Auth providers, after building my own simple authorization system utilizing salted bcrypt hashing.  Lastly I made my own design and layout to hone in CSS competencies and make the project my own. Clarafi Deep Learning API was utilized for face detection.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
